# About the project 
Pshallll Camp is a web application that allows you to view campgrounds with a short description. Once you log in or sign up you can begin to create your own campgrounds that include a title, image, address, and brief description. Explore the beautiful places  in the world through our website.

This project was a final point from the Web Bootcamp Course from Udemy.
This app supports user authentication, post management (creating, editing, and deleting), image uploading, responsive design, and client and server-side validations.
